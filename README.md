# gradeCalculator
this program is meant to serve as a general purpose grade calculator, a couple features of this program is to allow the user to
* Create custom name for each course, such as calculus2023, calculus(2023), calculusSpring, calculusFall, etc...
* Create custom items for each course, meaning chemistry2023 has the following items, homework, exams, classwork, etc...
* Create custom weights for those items, so the homework under calculus would be 20% of your grade, exams 80%, chemistry's homework could be 15% and its exams 85%.
